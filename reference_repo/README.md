3. ~~Kill myself~~

## ⚙️ Settings

### Main Panel Controls

- **Panel Position**: Left or Right side of the chat
- **Theme**: Choose from 6 built-in themes or create a custom
- **Auto-update after messages**: Automatically refresh RPG data after each message
- **Context Messages**: How many recent messages to include when generating updates (only for Separate generation mode)

### Display Options

- **Show User Stats**: Display the character stats panel
- **Show Info Box**: Display the scene information panel
- **Show Character Thoughts**: Display the AI character's internal thoughts

### Generation Modes

#### Together Mode

Tracker data is generated within the main AI response and automatically extracted:

Example:
User: walks into the tavern

AI: Trackers + Full roleplay response

↓ Extension extracts tracker data from the response

↓ Displays in sidebar panels

↓ Main chat shows clean roleplay text

Pros:
- Single API call
- Faster response
- Simpler setup

Cons:
- Tracker formatting mixed in AI response
- May affect roleplay quality slightly

#### Separate Mode

Tracker data is generated in a separate API call after the main response:

Example:
User: walks into the tavern

AI: Pure roleplay response - no tracker data

AI: Separate call with just the tracker data

↓ Extension sends a separate request with context

↓ AI generates only tracker data

↓ Displays in sidebar panels

↓ Context summary injected into the next generation

Pros:
- Clean roleplay responses
- Better roleplay quality
- Contextual summary enhances immersion

Cons:
- Extra API call
- Slightly slower

### Model Selection

- **Use main chat model**: Use the same model as your chat (recommended)
- Custom model selection (coming soon)

## 📝 How to Use

### Quick Start

1. Enable the extension in the Extensions tab
2. Choose your generation mode: Together or Separate
3. Select which panels to display (User Stats, Info Box, Character Thoughts)
4. Start chatting! The tracker updates automatically

### Editing Tracker Data

You can edit most fields by clicking on them:

- **Info Box**: Click on date fields, weather, temperature, time, or location
- **Character Thoughts**: Click on emoji, name, traits, relationship, or thoughts

Note: When editing character thoughts in the floating bubble, the bubble will refresh to maintain proper positioning.

## 🚀 Planned Features

- Support for selecting a different model for RPG updates

## 💡 Tips

1. **Context Messages**: Start with 4 messages and adjust based on your needs. More messages = better context, but slower updates
2. **Performance**: If updates are slow, consider reducing the context depth or using a faster model
3. **Customization**: You can modify the prompts in index.js to add your own stat categories or change the format

## 📋 Compatibility

- Requires SillyTavern 1.11.0 or higher
