# Code Review - 2025-10-23

## Summary of Changes

This update fixes several critical bugs that prevented the Story Tracker extension from loading and functioning correctly. The core issue was a data initialization race condition, which has now been resolved.

### 1. Fixed Data Initialization Flow
- **`index.js`**:
  - Modified the `initUI` function to properly `await` the `ensureTrackerDataInitialized` function.
  - Added a re-rendering call (`renderTracker()`) after the initial data is loaded to ensure the UI updates correctly.
  - Added a loading indicator to provide user feedback during initialization.
- **`src/core/dataManager.js`**:
  - Improved `ensureTrackerDataInitialized` with better error handling and logging.
  - It now correctly loads the default template when no data is present.
- **`src/core/persistence.js`**:
  - Updated `loadChatData` to prevent empty chat metadata from overwriting a freshly loaded default template.

### 2. Completed Missing Features
- **`src/systems/rendering/tracker.js`**:
  - Added the missing `updateField` function, which is required by the "Edit Field" modal.
- **`src/systems/ui/modals.js`**:
  - Corrected the `showEditFieldModal` function to properly pass the `newValue` to the `updateField` function.

### 3. UI/UX Improvements
- **`style.css`**:
  - Added a `.story-tracker-loader` class to style the new loading indicator.
- **`src/systems/rendering/tracker.js`**:
  - Improved the "empty" message to be more informative.

## Conclusion

With these fixes, the extension should now be fully functional. The data management features (import/export, format switching) should work as intended, and the UI should be responsive and provide clear feedback to the user.
