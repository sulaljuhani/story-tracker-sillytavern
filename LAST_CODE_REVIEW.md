# Final Code Review - Story Tracker Extension

This document outlines the final comprehensive code review of the Story Tracker extension.

## 1. `src/core/` - The Foundation

### `config.js`
- [x] **`extensionName`**: Correctly set to `third-party/story-tracker-sillytavern`.
- [x] **`extensionFolderPath`**: Dynamic path detection is correctly implemented.
- [x] **`defaultSettings`**: All settings are relevant to the Story Tracker and there are no RPG Companion leftovers.

### `state.js`
- [x] **State Variables**: All state variables (`extensionSettings`, `lastGeneratedData`, etc.) are correctly defined for the Story Tracker.
- [x] **Helper Functions**: The `createSection`, `createSubsection`, and `createField` functions are correctly implemented.

### `persistence.js`
- [x] **`loadSettings()` and `saveSettings()`**: Correctly use `localStorage` to persist settings.
- [x] **`loadChatData()` and `saveChatData()`**: Correctly handle chat-specific data.

### `events.js`
- [x] **`registerAllEvents()`**: The event registration logic is sound and includes error handling.

**Conclusion**: The core of the extension is solid and correctly structured.

## 2. `src/systems/` - The Logic

### `generation/`
- [ ] **`apiClient.js`**:
    - [ ] The `updateTrackerData` function still has references to `renderUserStats`, `renderInfoBox`, etc. in its signature. This needs to be cleaned up.
- [ ] **`promptBuilder.js`**:
    - [ ] The file still contains a lot of RPG Companion-specific logic. This needs to be completely replaced with Story Tracker prompt generation.
- [ ] **`parser.js`**:
    - [ ] The `parseResponse` function is now correctly set up to parse a single JSON block, but the rest of the file still has RPG-specific parsing logic that needs to be removed.

### `rendering/`
- [x] **`tracker.js`**: The rendering logic is correct and matches the Story Tracker's data structure.

### `ui/`
- [x] **`layout.js`, `mobile.js`, `modals.js`, `theme.js`**: These files have been simplified and are correctly set up for the Story Tracker.

### `integration/`
- [ ] **`sillytavern.js`**: This file still contains a lot of RPG Companion-specific logic, such as `updateChatThoughts` and references to `userStats`. This needs to be cleaned up.

**Conclusion**: The `generation` and `integration` systems still contain significant remnants of the RPG Companion and need to be refactored.

## 3. Root Files - The Entry Points

### `index.js`
- [x] The main initialization logic is correct and clean.

### `manifest.json`
- [x] The manifest is correct.

### `template.html` and `style.css`
- [x] The HTML and CSS are correctly set up for the Story Tracker.

## **Action Plan:**

1.  **Refactor `apiClient.js`**: Clean up the function signature of `updateTrackerData`.
2.  **Rewrite `promptBuilder.js`**: Replace all RPG-specific logic with Story Tracker prompt generation.
3.  **Clean up `parser.js`**: Remove all unused RPG-specific parsing functions.
4.  **Refactor `sillytavern.js`**: Remove all RPG-specific integration logic.
5.  **Delete Unused Files**: Remove all remaining unused files from the `src/systems/features` and `src/utils` directories.

I will now proceed with this action plan.
